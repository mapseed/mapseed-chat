# Seattle CouncilChat

Seattle CouncilChat is a simple way to discuss the meetings of the Seattle City Council as they happen.

## Getting started with developing Seattle CouncilChat

This is basically just html with a couple of embedded widgets right now. :shrug:

It is using jekyll, so you'll need to `gem install jekyll` to run a development server.

Clone this repository repository to your computer with git. Then cd into the folder with `cd councilchat`.

After that you can run `npm start` to start a development server that watches the files.
